So I paid $19.99 for a package that was to be delivered today and due to UPS incompetence, my package is delayed because they sent it to the WRONG UPS FACILITY!!!!!!! Even though the address is on the package. This i don’t understand.

You guys left a not at my door saying a missed a package. I was home for the whole day waiting for this package and never heard a door ring or anything. I went to the local pick up location and they claim they don’t even have my package. The tracking number also says “The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible.”
Like what is even going on. I have no idea where my package is and it’s impossible to get by the real customer service rep on the phone when you call. This is crazy… my package could be stolen I would have no idea.

Why do your drivers say they can’t deliver a package because my address was missing when IT IS CORRECT on the package and in the system?!

I will NEVER use ups again. Tell me why my plant package that was supposed to be delivered last Wed which was sent a week ago is in Jacksonville in some warehouse and wont be delivered until Tuesday. All of these plants are going to be dead. I am livid! I was told by 3 different customer service reps that someone would be calling me back. No one has called me. This is the worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!!
