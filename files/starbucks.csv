777,"❤️I have to give a shout-out to my favorite Starbucks store and manager, she was the manager of Loganville, GA store, now she is over the Bethlehem, GA. Ashley you are always so kind and always asking everyone how I'm doing, Sins iv been ordered by the Dr to drink coffee and espresso every day to keep my heart rate up over 40, you made sure i had my order ready every day. We ask each other about our kids, Your workers love you as well I think you deserve a shout out for everything you do. Your not only the manager at Starbucks, but you've become our friend. We love you. 🎗🫂🤩❤️ ☕️🧋thank you all for your hard work. And having to deal with the rude people sometimes, just know it's not your fault so don't take it personal.
