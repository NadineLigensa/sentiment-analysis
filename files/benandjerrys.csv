When I returned to the Ben and Jerry’s and showed the one worker there and showed her the bandage she automatically accused me and my fiancé of putting it in my sundae on purpose. She completely denied this and got loud and disrespectful. And started calling me and my fiancé names like bitch and telling us to shut up. She kept being disrespectful and loud. She refused to provide her name, corporate number, and who she reports too. Instead she told us that she was the manager. As she refunded our $15 she slammed it down in front of us completely disrespectfully. She never apologized For this incident and instead called security. I have video proof of the entire incident showing the bandage with blood on it. I will post it and let everyone know not to eat at tht location.

I am 16 weeks pregnant and once I got to the bottom of the sundae and I put a spoonful in my mouth I noticed that I was chewing on a foreign object. I pulled out a bandage and it was curled up with blood on it. I never left Ben and Jerry’s inside of harrahs as I was waiting to return my scooter my fiancé had got for me. When I returned to the Ben and Jerry’s and showed the one worker there and showed her the bandage she automatically accused me and my fiancé of putting it in my sundae on purpose. She completely denied this and got loud and disrespectful. And started calling me and my fiancé names like bitch and telling us to shut up. She kept being disrespectful and loud. She refused to provide her name, corporate number, and who she reports too. Instead she told us that she was the manager. As she refunded our $15 she slammed it down in front of us completely disrespectfully. She never apologized For this incident and instead called security. I have video proof of the entire incident showing the bandage with blood on it. I will post it and let everyone know not to eat at tht location. The woman didn’t have and gloves on and acted very disrespectfully. I will bring it to corporate and get tested to make sure myself and my unborn child are safe.",False,political,CuRsDUMtQvn
