Global warming is climate change, the overall global temperature has risen which impacts the jet stream and weather patterns, and caused more frequent storms extreme weather. This means it can be lower than average temperatures in some places but the precipitation can still be lower and that has cumulative impacts. The climate is a global system and it‚Äôs about long term trends.
