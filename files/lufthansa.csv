Finally, the arrangement would be to pick up here in Cappadocia, where I arrived at 12:30 pm. They asked me to wait because between 14:30/15:30 the suitcase would finally be delivered to me. Absurdly, they said that if it wasn't like that, they would only deliver me to the hotel after 2, 3 days. Detail, I won't even be here anymore, the stay in Cappadocia is short. It's almost 4:30 pm. On the planes that arrived from Istanbul, none of my luggage. I had to separate from the group with me. I will have to pay for another airport-hotel transfer, because I missed the one scheduled.

I was relocated to the next flight. *AND, NOW, I HAVE BEEN 3 DAYS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO RECOVER MY LUGGAGE.* Inside it, medicines and documents that I need. Clothes, I had to buy. At first, they would deliver my bag to the hotel I was staying in Istanbul on 7/12, Wednesday. Then they moved to 7/13, Thursday. Initially, until 10 am. Then until midnight. And nothing, nothing from the suitcase arriving. A series of WhatsApp messages from the company +905336478692. Each time a new luggage delivery schedule. Finally, the arrangement would be to pick up here in Cappadocia, where I arrived at 12:30 pm. They asked me to wait because between 14:30/15:30 the suitcase would finally be delivered to me. Absurdly, they said that if it wasn't like that, they would only deliver me to the hotel after 2, 3 days. Detail, I won't even be here anymore, the stay in Cappadocia is short. It's almost 4:30 pm. On the planes that arrived from Istanbul, none of my luggage. I had to separate from the group with me. I will have to pay for another airport-hotel transfer, because I missed the one scheduled. Several annoyances. And nothing concrete from Lufthansa. This company is making me review the concepts I had about the discipline, excellence, promptness that German companies are supposed to have. It's all surreal. They're playing with me, making a clown out of me. #lufthansa",False,None,CuWP1-jIyha,0
