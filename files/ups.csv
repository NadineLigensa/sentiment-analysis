78,UPS is responsible for losing a package purchased from Amazon worth almost $200.00 and refuses to pay for lost item even though they admit they're culpable and agreed to pay for the items lost. Had to report them to the BBB as well as local consumer action news network to try to receive some satisfaction. They've between Amazon and UPS done nothing but give me the run around as well as continuously pass me back and forth each blaming the other. Two huge companies who have no American customer support at all. Always connected to the Philippines where there is little to no professionalism as well as a definite language barrier. Very bad experience all the way around. In the meantime my credit is in jeopardy due to this matter as UPS refuses to pay for their admitted mistake.,False,Environmental,CviSHXcxvuG,3

188,UPS = Useless Parcel Service .. I refused a package 2 weeks ago that I didn’t know had customs on it. 2 weeks go by the sender and I I was under the impression that the package was on the way back to him so I could get my refund. A few days ago it showed up back at my house when I was away and I received a letter today in the mail that there will be late charges if I don’t pay. Why was the package I REFUSED brought back to my house? I spoke to someone who gave me a number to document our phone call and she said UPS would call me to schedule a pick up (I laughed) I called someone today and asked for a number to document the call and she said they do no such thing. So I guess the other woman just gave me random numbers? She then said that someone will come by in a day or two to pick up the package. My mind is blown how a company this large operates the way it does. It’s actually insane. How can you threaten someone with late charges when they refused the package weeks ago and they don’t even want it?! Why was it brought back to my house? Also why even have customer service? They never help,False,workplace,CvaRxNCs9EE,2
