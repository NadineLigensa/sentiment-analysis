This post aligns perfectly with their company ethos and values. If they don't agree then why do they follow the brand? Why do they interact with the posts? The truth is that the climate is changing in unnatural ways and in an unnatural speed due to our actions. The planet itself will be absolutely fine but humans won't be. We're seeing the effects now and some people, specifically in the poorer countries, have been more affected. We need to understand the facts and react accordingly and if some people have been misled to believe that this isn't an important issue, then at least they can shut up, step aside, and let the rest of us deal with it in a mature and scientific way.
