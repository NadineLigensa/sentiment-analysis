Hi Eric - if someone is interested in R&D at Patagonia or other outdoor companies, what skills do you suggest they focus on to enter this type of work?

When will Patagonia make a running pack for the urban running commuter. Specifically, something that can fit a medium sized laptop, change of clothes and a lunch with no chafing? I find far more people I know need this use case vs running 150 miles in Sweden (which is awesome, BTW, but not what most people are searching for).

Hi Eric! My brother lives in Sweden and we were looking for a good adventure. Your running trip looked great. Which section of the trail did you do? How was planning the trip? Any tips or websites that helped a lot?

Do you feel like traditional schooling - day to day life in school, homework, testing, etc - prepared you for what you do? In other words, I’m super curious if you think our current education systems are supportive, neutral, or a hinderance towards moving into careers that are purpose and passion driven, like yours seems to be.

Hi Eric, very cool title? Did you study product design or is this just a passion you got into? I am curious about a creative employment opportunity and I’m just wondering if you have any advice towards that.

Eric - Amazing. When working with materials, where do you find the threshold between performance versus environmental responsibility? Will you employ “less responsible” materials in the name of performance and function in Tier 1 gear and equipment? no wrong answers. Thanks!

Hey Eric and Patagonia. You guys are great! I have a question on carrying things.

As human, when we didn't have bags, we carried things with our hands and arm. This means that we're loading the front of the body. We've been doing this since we set foot on earth, which makes sense because we have a lever in front of our body (our feet) - so things kind of balance out, thanks Newton!

All backpacks in history load the back of the body - to compensate the load, we lean forward, often using our core (good) but often loading our lower back (bad). Putting all of your things on your back (asides for water bottles) negates the 30cm lever your feet naturally give you.

With this is mind my question is: why not distribute the bag's volume both on the back, and the front?

Being a trail runner I understand that you have to see your feet - so I guess the front packing limit is set by this - being able to see your toes.

Much love from South Africa, drinking a good coffee and listening to the soundtrack of your video on repeat because I have not paused it. Ha! 🌞
